This project was developed as the final submission for UVic Computer Animation course. The primary goals of this project was to explore, research, and develop a animation system. During this project I conducted extensive research into particle systems while developing, combining, creating, and tinkering with particle simulation approaches. For more detailed explanation of the project check out my paper linked above.
