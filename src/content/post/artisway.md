*Project for UVic Startup Programming course*

Live Website: https://www.artisway.ca/

Artisway was started in UVic Startup Programming course by our team of 5 students guided by a board of mentors with the goal of developing a real world solution to some problem.

## Inspiration behind Artisway

Our team was drawn to the vibrant spirit of local markets. However, we also saw limitations. Vendors struggle with limited hours and table space, and setting up an online store can be daunting and expensive. As buyers, we all want to support local artisans, too, but finding those unique treasures can feel like a scavenger hunt.

## My Impact

Within the team I took primary responsibility of the back-end development. During the 4-month stretch I learned many new skills such as React, Typescript and API development needed for the success of our product. During my time on the project I built, designed and managed the Postgresql database; designed and implemented APIs; established and maintained development environment, deployment, and GitHub repository.
